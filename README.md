# Weather-Set up your own weather website
## How to use
1. You gotta have an Yahoo weather API, I got it from rapidAPI: https://rapidapi.com/apishub/api/yahoo-weather5/, it's free(unless you use too much) and won't need your card info.
2. Fill the API into the script.js, there's a sign to tell you where to fill.
